= RELEASE HISTORY

== 0.5 / 2008-10-25

Brite (formerly Webrite) has been completely rewritten from the ground-up,
applying a number of ideas gathered from other systems and adding further
innovations. This is still an early release, and in need of features
and overt tire-kicking, but hey I'm already using to generate a pretty
damn nice looking site.

Changes:

* 1 Monumentously Important Enhancment

    * Happy Rebirthday!
